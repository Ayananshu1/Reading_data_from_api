This is a small yet a very important concept on how to read data and perform operations on specific data from an api.

The process involves:
1.importing the requests package which helps to read data from an api
2.Going to the url of the server whose data we want to read and generating an api key.
3.Getting the url of the api key
4.Using get method to send Http Request to the specific server
5.Converting the returned response to a json format.
6.Running a for loop through the variable storing the json data and using the keyname whose data we want.
